# Decentralized Recovery Protocol (DRP)

## Product Name
**LifeKey Protocol** – assets live on even if keys are lost.

## Introduction
In blockchain ecosystems today, one of the biggest risks to individuals is **loss of access to digital assets** due to misplaced private keys or inaccessible wallets. Unlike stolen funds, which are a legal and forensic challenge, **lost funds have no standard mechanism for recovery**.  

This project proposes a **smart contract framework on EVM-compatible chains** that introduces a recovery model based on **beneficiary consensus**. The protocol maintains decentralization, avoids third-party custodianship, and provides resilience for asset owners.

## Problem
- **Lost private keys = permanent loss of funds**  
- No standardized approach to designate trusted recovery parties  
- Billions of dollars in assets remain unrecoverable  
- Users fear onboarding into crypto due to these risks  

---

## Proposed Solution

### 1. User Registration & Approval
- Users register their wallets with the recovery contract.  
- They grant **approval** for the contract to manage recovery if needed.  
- Each user sets a list of **beneficiaries** (trusted addresses).  

### 2. Recovery Request
- If the owner loses access, one beneficiary can initiate a **recovery request**.  
- The request proposes a **new owner address**.  

### 3. Consensus Mechanism
- Other beneficiaries vote to approve or reject the request.  
- A **minimum threshold** (e.g., majority or predefined %) must approve.  

### 4. Ownership Update
- Once approved, the contract updates the official "owner" address.  
- The new owner gains full access to claim the assets.  

### 5. Fund Claim
- The **claim function** uses `transferFrom` or equivalent safe transfers.  
- All recoverable funds are moved from the old wallet to the new owner.

## Tokenomics & Sustainability
- **Presale model** to raise initial funds.  
- **Transaction fee structure** ensures long-term sustainability.  
- **Buyback & burn mechanism** with part of the fees → strengthens token value.  

---

## Impact
- **Users:** Safer entry into blockchain, reduced risk of catastrophic loss.  
- **Ecosystem:** More trust and stability in digital asset management.  
- **Academia & Industry:** Opens new avenues for research and innovation on decentralized recovery systems.  
- **Financial Systems:** Supports long-term sustainability through tokenomics.  

---

## Future Work
This project is in the **idea and design phase**. Planned enhancements include:
- Expanding to a **multi-chain protocol** (beyond EVM).  
- Integration with **account abstraction (ERC-4337)** for smoother user experience.  
- Formal **verification & auditing** of the recovery logic.    
- Potential **integration with wallets** and **DeFi platforms**.  
- Exploration of the **legal and regulatory dimensions** of decentralized recovery.  

---

## Frontend Playground
- Navigate to `frontend/` for a Vite + React implementation of the owner, beneficiary, and claim consoles.  
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`, add `VITE_LIFEKEY_PROXY`, RPC URL, and chain id, then run `npm install` followed by `npm run dev`.  
- The app bundles the contract ABI (see `src/assets/abi`) and uses wagmi/viem for on-chain reads, writes, and live event updates.

## Roadmap
1. **Prototype Smart Contract** → implement basic recovery workflow.  
2. **Security Audit & Testing** → fuzzing, formal verification, simulations.  
3. **Presale & Tokenomics Launch** → establish sustainable model.  
4. **Mainnet Deployment** → make protocol accessible to real users.  
5. **Continuous Refactoring** → idea will be enhanced and updated over time.

## Note
This repository serves as a **proof of ownership** and foundation for a future product or protocol.  
The idea will be **continuously refactored and enhanced** as feedback, research insights, and technical improvements are incorporated.
